# Portfolio & Watchlist Manager

## Overview

**Portfolio & Watchlist Manager** is a full-stack web application for managing investment portfolios and personal stock watchlists. It allows you to create and manage multiple portfolios, add or remove assets, monitor real-time and historical prices, and visualize risk and performance analytics with interactive charts.

This project was developed by Alessandro as a personal learning exercise to gain experience with React, JavaScript, Go, and working with financial APIs.  
**It is not intended for production use or real investment decisions. Data may be incomplete or delayed, and features may be experimental.**

## Environment Variables & API Keys

Before running the backend, you **must** set up your environment variables for API access.

1. **Copy the example environment file**  
   In the `Backend` directory, duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.

2. **Edit your API keys**  
   Open the new `.env` file and replace the placeholders with your actual API keys:
   ```
   FINNHUB_API_KEY=your-finnhub-api-key
   POLYGON_API_KEY=your-polygon-api-key
   ```

   cd Portfolio-Watchlist-Manager
   ```

2. **Backend:**
   - Navigate to the `Backend` folder.
   - **Set up your `.env` file with API keys as described above.**
   - Run the backend server:
     ```sh
     go run main.go
     ```
   - The backend will listen on `127.0.0.1:3000`.

3. **Frontend:**
   - Navigate to the `Frontend` folder.
   - Install dependencies:
     ```sh
     npm install
     ```
